  * `err` {Error}
  * `repl` {repl.REPLServer}

Initializes a history log file for the REPL instance. When executing the
Node.js binary and using the command line REPL, a history file is initialized
by default. However, this is not the case when creating a REPL
programmatically. Use this method to initialize a history log file when working
with REPL instances programmatically.
