ECMAScript modules are [the official standard format][] to package JavaScript
code for reuse. Modules are defined using a variety of [`import`][] and
[`export`][] statements.

Node.js fully supports ECMAScript modules as they are currently specified and
provides limited interoperability between them and the existing module format,
[CommonJS][].

Node.js contains support for ES Modules based upon the
[Node.js EP for ES Modules][] and the [ECMAScript-modules implementation][].

Expect major changes in the implementation including interoperability support,
specifier resolution, and default behavior.
