* `offset` {integer} Number of bytes to skip before starting to read. Must
  satisfy: `0 <= offset <= buf.length - 8`. **Default:** `0`.
* Returns: {bigint}

Reads a signed 64-bit integer from `buf` at the specified `offset` with
the specified endian format (`readBigInt64BE()` returns big endian,
`readBigInt64LE()` returns little endian).

Integers read from a `Buffer` are interpreted as two's complement signed values.
