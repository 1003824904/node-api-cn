Type: End-of-Life

Use of the [`crypto.pbkdf2()`][] API without specifying a digest was deprecated
in Node.js 6.0 because the method defaulted to using the non-recommended
`'SHA1'` digest. Previously, a deprecation warning was printed. Starting in
Node.js 8.0.0, calling `crypto.pbkdf2()` or `crypto.pbkdf2Sync()` with an
undefined `digest` will throw a `TypeError`.
