* `options` {Object}
  * `timeout` {integer} Specifies the number of milliseconds to evaluate
    before terminating execution. If execution is interrupted, an [`Error`][]
    will be thrown. This value must be a strictly positive integer.
  * `breakOnSigint` {boolean} If `true`, the execution will be terminated when
    `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) is received. Existing handlers for the event that have
    been attached via `process.on('SIGINT')` will be disabled during script
    execution, but will continue to work after that. If execution is
    interrupted, an [`Error`][] will be thrown.
* Returns: {Promise}

Evaluate the module.

This must be called after the module has been instantiated; otherwise it will
throw an error. It could be called also when the module has already been
evaluated, in which case it will do one of the following two things:

- return `undefined` if the initial evaluation ended in success (`module.status`
  is `'evaluated'`)
- rethrow the same exception the initial evaluation threw if the initial
  evaluation ended in an error (`module.status` is `'errored'`)

This method cannot be called while the module is being evaluated
(`module.status` is `'evaluating'`) to prevent infinite recursion.

Corresponds to the [Evaluate() concrete method][] field of [Source Text Module
Record][]s in the ECMAScript specification.
